## AWS Cloud Engineer Interview Questions and Answers

**1. Question: Explain the difference between EC2 instance types and sizes.**

**Answer:**

* **Instance types:** Define the hardware configuration of an EC2 instance, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. Examples include `t2.micro`, `m5.large`, and `c5.xlarge`. They are optimized for different workloads.
* **Instance sizes:** Refer to the specific resources allocated within an instance type. For example, `m5.large` and `m5.xlarge` are different sizes within the `m5` instance type family.

**2. Question: What are the different storage options available in AWS, and when would you use each?**

**Answer:**

* **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Object storage for storing and retrieving any amount of data, used for backups, media storage, and static website hosting.
* **EBS (Elastic Block Storage):** Block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances, used for operating systems, databases, and applications requiring persistent storage.
* **EFS (Elastic File System):** Scalable file storage for EC2 instances, used for shared file systems, content management, and web serving.
* **Instance Store:** Temporary block-level storage physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, offering high performance but non-persistent storage.
* **Glacier/Glacier Deep Archive:** Low-cost storage for archiving and long-term backups.

**3. Question: How do you ensure high availability for an application running on EC2?**

**Answer:**

* **Multiple Availability Zones (AZs):** Deploying instances across multiple AZs ensures that if one AZ fails, the application remains available.
* **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):** Distributing traffic across multiple instances to prevent overloading any single instance and provide fault tolerance.
* **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs):** Automatically scaling the number of instances based on demand or health checks.
* **Route 53:** Using Route 53 for DNS failover and health checks.
* **RDS Multi-AZ:** for database redundancy.

**4. Question: What is the purpose of VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?**

**Answer:**

* VPC allows you to create a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
* It provides control over your virtual networking environment, including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.
* It allows you to create secure, private networks within AWS.

**5. Question: Explain the difference between public and private subnets.**

**Answer:**

* **Public Subnet:** Instances in a public subnet can connect to the internet via an Internet Gateway. They typically have public IP addresses.
* **Private Subnet:** Instances in a private subnet cannot directly connect to the internet. They can communicate with other resources within the VPC and can access the internet through a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance.

**6. Question: What is AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)?**

**Answer:**

* IAM enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
* You can create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.
* IAM allows you to implement the principle of least privilege.

**7. Question: What are IAM roles and policies?**

**Answer:**

* **IAM Roles:** Provide permissions to AWS services or applications running on EC2 instances to access other AWS resources without needing to embed credentials.
* **IAM Policies:** Define the permissions granted to users, groups, or roles. Policies are written in JSON and specify what actions are allowed or denied on which resources.

**8. Question: Explain AWS Lambda and its use cases.**

**Answer:**

* AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
* Use cases include:
    * Serverless web applications
    * Data processing
    * Real-time data streaming
    * Automated backups
    * Chatbots.

**9. Question: What is AWS CloudFormation?**

**Answer:**

* AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows you to define and provision AWS infrastructure using a template.
* It automates the process of creating, updating, and deleting AWS resources.
* It allows for version control of your Infrastructure.

**10. Question: What is the purpose of AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service)?**

**Answer:**

* SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
* It allows you to send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.

**11. Question: What is the difference between SQS and SNS (Simple Notification Service)?**

**Answer:**

* **SQS:** A queuing service used for decoupling applications and processing messages asynchronously. Messages are stored until they are processed.
* **SNS:** A publish/subscribe messaging service used for sending notifications to subscribers. Messages are pushed to subscribers immediately.

**12. Question: What is AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)?**

**Answer:**

* RDS is a managed relational database service that simplifies setting up, operating, and scaling a relational database in the cloud.
* It supports various database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.

**13. Question: How do you monitor the performance of your AWS resources?**

**Answer:**

* **CloudWatch:** Provides monitoring and observability of AWS resources and applications. It collects metrics, logs, and events, allowing you to set alarms and create dashboards.
* **CloudTrail:** Logs API calls made to your AWS account, providing an audit trail of actions taken.
* **Trusted Advisor:** Provides recommendations for optimizing your AWS infrastructure for security, cost, performance, and fault tolerance.

**14. Question: What is the purpose of a NAT Gateway?**

**Answer:**

* A NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, while preventing the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.
* It is used to enable outbound internet access for private instances.

**15. Question: What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework?**

**Answer:**

* The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud.
* It is based on five pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization.
