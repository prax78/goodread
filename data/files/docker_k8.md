### 4. What is a Dockerfile?
**Answer:**  
A `Dockerfile` is a script containing instructions to build a Docker image.

Example:
```dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

---

### 5. What is the difference between `COPY` and `ADD` in Dockerfile?
**Answer:**  
- **COPY**: Copies files from the local system.
- **ADD**: Same as COPY but can also extract archives.

Example:
```dockerfile
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
ADD myapp.tar.gz /app/
```

---

**Answer:**  
**Docker Volume** is used for persisting data across container restarts.

Example:
```sh
docker volume create myvolume
docker run -v myvolume:/app/data myapp
```

---

### 8. What is Docker Compose?
**Answer:**  
Docker Compose is a tool to define multi-container applications using a YAML file.

Example `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:

    ports:
      - "80:80"
```
Start services:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

|---------|-----|-----------|
| Override | Can be overridden | Cannot be overridden |
| Usage | Default command | Main process |

Example:
```dockerfile
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

---

### 10. How do you check running Docker containers?
**Answer:**  
```sh
docker ps      # Running containers
docker ps -a   # All containers
```

# Kubernetes & Docker Interview Questions and Answers

## Docker Basics

**Q: What is Docker?**

**A:** Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers package up an application and all its dependencies, ensuring that the application runs reliably in any environment.

**Q: What are the benefits of using Docker?**

**A:**
* **Consistency:** Ensures applications run the same way across different environments.
* **Isolation:** Containers isolate applications from each other and the host system.
* **Portability:** Containers can run on any system that supports Docker.
* **Efficiency:** Containers are lightweight and use fewer resources than virtual machines.
* **Rapid Deployment:** Enables faster application deployment and scaling.

**Q: What is a Docker image?**

**A:** A Docker image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. It's like a snapshot of an application and its dependencies.

**Q: What is a Docker container?**

**A:** A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It's a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application.

**Q: What is a Dockerfile?**

**A:** A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

**Q: What is Docker Compose?**

**A:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure application services.

**Q: What is a Docker volume?**

**A:** A Docker volume is a persistent storage mechanism used to store data generated by or used by Docker containers. It allows data to persist even if the container is deleted.

**Q: What is a Docker network?**

**A:** Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other. They provide isolation and connectivity for containers.

## Kubernetes Basics

**Q: What is Kubernetes?**

**A:** Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.

**Q: What are the benefits of using Kubernetes?**

**A:**
* **Scalability:** Easily scale applications up or down.
* **High Availability:** Ensures applications are always running.
* **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Automatically discovers services and distributes traffic.
* **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks:** Enables seamless application updates.
* **Resource Optimization:** Efficiently uses hardware resources.

**Q: What is a Pod in Kubernetes?**

**A:** A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It's a group of one or more containers that share storage and network resources.

**Q: What is a Deployment in Kubernetes?**

**A:** A Deployment is a Kubernetes resource that manages the deployment of Pods. It ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running.

**Q: What is a Service in Kubernetes?**

**A:** A Service is an abstraction that exposes an application running in a set of Pods as a network service. It provides a stable IP address and DNS name for accessing Pods.

**Q: What is a Namespace in Kubernetes?**

**A:** A Namespace is a virtual cluster within a Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to partition cluster resources and isolate applications.

**Q: What is a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes?**

**A:** A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time. It's typically managed by a Deployment.

**Q: What is a Kubernetes Node?**

**A:** A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes. It runs Pods and is managed by the Kubernetes control plane.

**Q: What is a Kubernetes Cluster?**

**A:** A Kubernetes Cluster is a set of Node machines that run containerized applications.

**Q: What is kubectl?**

**A:** `kubectl` is the command-line tool used to interact with the Kubernetes API server and manage Kubernetes resources.
