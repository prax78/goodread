## Git Basics

**Q: What is Git?**

**A:** Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently. It enables you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and manage branches.

**Q: What is a repository in Git?**

**A:** A repository, or "repo," is a directory containing all project files and their revision history. It stores snapshots of files at different points in time.

**Q: What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**

**A:**
* `git fetch` downloads changes from a remote repository but doesn't merge them into your local branch.
* `git pull` downloads changes and automatically merges them into your current local branch. It's essentially `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.

**Q: What is a branch in Git?**

**A:** A branch is a separate line of development in a repository. It allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

**Q: What is a commit in Git?**

**A:** A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the files in a repository at a specific point in time. It includes a message describing the changes.

**Q: What is the purpose of the `.gitignore` file?**

**A:** The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories that Git should ignore and not track. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive information.

**Q: Explain the Git workflow.**

**A:** A typical Git workflow involves:
1.  Creating a local repository.
2.  Making changes to files.
3.  Staging changes with `git add`.
4.  Committing changes with `git commit`.
5.  Pushing changes to a remote repository with `git push`.
6.  Pulling changes from a remote repository with `git pull`.
7.  Branching for new features or fixes.
8.  Merging branches.

## Git Commands

**Q: What does `git status` do?**

**A:** `git status` displays the current state of the working directory and staging area. It shows which files have been modified, staged, or are untracked.

**Q: What does `git add` do?**

**A:** `git add` stages changes for the next commit. It adds files or directories to the staging area.

**Q: What does `git commit` do?**

**A:** `git commit` creates a snapshot of the staged changes and saves them to the repository's history.

**Q: What does `git push` do?**

**A:** `git push` uploads local commits to a remote repository.

**Q: What does `git pull` do?**

**A:** `git pull` downloads changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current local branch.

**Q: What does `git branch` do?**

**A:** `git branch` lists, creates, or deletes branches.

**Q: What does `git merge` do?**

**A:** `git merge` combines changes from one branch into another.

**Q: What does `git rebase` do?**

**A:** `git rebase` integrates changes from one branch into another by reapplying commits on top of the target branch. It creates a linear history.

**Q: What does `git revert` do?**

**A:** `git revert` creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit.

**Q: What does `git reset` do?**

**A:** `git reset` resets the current branch to a specified state. It can be used to unstage changes or discard commits.

## GitHub Basics

**Q: What is GitHub?**

**A:** GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, collaboration tools, and version control features.

**Q: What is a pull request?**

**A:** A pull request is a feature that allows developers to propose changes to a repository. It enables code review and discussion before merging changes.

**Q: What is a fork?**

**A:** A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub that you create in your own account. It allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

**Q: What is a merge conflict?**

**A:** A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches. It requires manual intervention to resolve the conflicts.

**Q: What is the difference between a fork and a branch?**

**A:** A fork is a copy of an entire repository, while a branch is a separate line of development within the same repository.

**Q: What are GitHub Actions?**

**A:** GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that automates workflows within GitHub repositories.

**Q: What are GitHub Pages?**

**A:** GitHub Pages is a service that allows you to host websites directly from your GitHub repositories.

**Q: What are GitHub issues?**

**A:** GitHub issues are used to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests within a repository. They provide a platform for discussion and collaboration.

**Q: How do you resolve a merge conflict?**

**A:** To resolve a merge conflict:
1.  Open the files with conflicts.
2.  Edit the files to resolve the conflicting changes.
3.  Stage the resolved files with `git add`.
4.  Commit the changes with `git commit`.

# Git/GitHub Interview Questions and Answers - Chat GPT

## 1. What is Git?
**Answer:**  
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that helps track changes in source code during software development. It enables multiple developers to collaborate efficiently.

---

## 2. What is GitHub?
**Answer:**  
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and CI/CD integrations.

---

## 3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
**Answer:**  
| Feature  | Git | GitHub |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Type     | Version control system | Hosting service for Git repositories |
| Usage    | Manages local and remote repositories | Provides web interface, issue tracking, CI/CD |
| Installation | Installed locally | Cloud-based |

---

## 4. How do you initialize a Git repository?
**Answer:**  
Run the following command in a project directory:
```sh
git init
```
This creates a hidden `.git` folder that stores version control data.

---

## 5. What are the different Git states?
**Answer:**  
1. **Modified** - File is changed but not staged.  
2. **Staged** - File is added to the staging area.  
3. **Committed** - Changes are saved in the local repository.  

---

## 6. How do you check the status of a Git repository?
**Answer:**  
```sh
git status
```
This command shows modified, staged, and untracked files.

---
